# ReFi Score

ReFi Score is a decentralized protocol designed to create a dashboard showcasing the leading communities and companies in regenerative finance (ReFi). Our goal is to provide a fair and transparent platform that efficiently connects donors and projects. By utilizing blockchain technology, we present the results and impact of these projects on-chain, scoring them based on their impact. This ensures that both donors and projects can maximize their impact profits.

## Mission

Our mission is to transform regenerative finance into a public good by creating an infrastructure that allows for the evaluation, funding, and tracking of projects based on their social and environmental impact. We aim to make regeneration a profitable and accessible process for all, promoting a more equitable and sustainable economy.
